## My process

### Folder structure

- Created the basic file structure for NextJS projects with creating a pages folder and adding index.js, \_app.js and \_document.js files in it.
- Then created a public folder and dumped all the images and design files in it.
- Created a styles folder and added \_design.scss partial sass file and styles.scss which is the main stylesheet.
- Added .gitignore file and created a package.json file in root directory.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned how to use images optimization in NextJS and worked on my CSS skills.

### Continued development

- Responsive part needs work as it is not working as expected on all screen sizes.
- Working on CSS part to reduce the amount of unnecessary code.
- Building this project took again over 4 hrs. It is less than previous solution which I worked with but I time reduction is very important for better productivity, so this needs work.
